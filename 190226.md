# History of Computer Graphics
- Most important problems in the early years: **visibility algorithms** and **geometric representations**.
- [Whitted (1980)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1198555.1198743) introduced the idea of using ray tracing for global lighting effects
- Cook and Torrance (1981, 1982): microfacet reflection models to graphics.
- Goral et al. (1984): thermal transfer + rendering (radiosity)
  - Practically not feasible because of the quadratic time complexity $O(n^2)$
- Cook et al. (1984): generalized Whitted's algorithm to compute motion blur and defocus blur from cameras, blurry reflection from glossy surfaces, and illumination from area light sources
- Kajiya (1986): path racing (**Monte Carlo integration**) -> very computationally expensive to render a 256 x 256 pixel image (7 hours of computation) ~ $280K at the time (!!)
- Production: Voyager 2, Star Trek II
- In the early 2000s, Pixar's RenderMan renderer started to support hybrid rasterization and ray-tracing algorithms and included some innovative algorithms for computing global illumination solutions in complex scenes.
