# What is a ray tracer?
- Ray tracing is a technique that simulates how light travels in the real world.
- Raster image: a digital image made up of a rectangular grid of tiny colored (usually square) so-called pixels.
- Optical Ray Tracing: tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.
- Mathematical Algorithm's input:
  - Eye position: $E \in R^3$
  - Target position: $T \in R^3$
  - Field of view: $\theta \in [0,\pi ]$
  - $m,k\in \mathbb {N}$ numbers of square pixels on viewport vertical and horizontal direction
  - $i,j\in \mathbb {N} ,1\leq i\leq k\land 1\leq j\leq m$ numbers of actual pixel
  - ${\vec {v}}\in \mathbb {R^{3}}$ vertical vector which indicates where is up and down
- Did a review on linear algebra. highly recommend this book: https://stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf
## C++ Fundamental Types
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types.html
- `signed` and `unsigned` keywords are type modifiers that define the range of values an integer variable can hold
  - `signed`: can store both positive and negative values
  - `unsigned`: can store only non-negative values
- `short`: target type will be optimized for space and will have a width of at least 16 bits.
- `long`: target type will have a width of at least 32 bits.
- `long long`: target type will have a width of at least 64 bits.
- `float`: single precision
- `double`: double precision
- `long double`: extended precision floating-point type
