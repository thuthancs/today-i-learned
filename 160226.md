# Computer Graphics
Today, I've learned about Bùi Tường Phong - a computer graphics pioneer who is the creator of [Phong shading algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading), which is the shading algorithm used in many applications today to improve the realism of an object. When I found out about this, I was so inspired and took an immense pride in my Vietnamese roots. 

What struck me the most is how complex it is to develop an algorithm for just "shading". It reinforces my belief everything in nature can be encoded/simulated using math in one way or another.

## Phong Shading Algorithm
### Definitions
I found it hard to wrap my head around this algorithm as a computer graphics newbie but what I always find very helpful is list out all the jargon/technical terms on the first skim:
- [Hidden surface removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination): the process of identifying what surfaces and parts of surfaces can be seen from a particular viewing angle (e.g., because they lie behind opaque objects such as walls).
- [Planar polygonal mosaic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/965139.807388) (used for surface _approximation_): a collection of polygons, such as triangles, squares, or hexagons, that perfectly fill a two-dimensional Euclidean plane without gaps or overlaps.
- [Binary subdivision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_subdivision_rule): a recursive method that splits a geometric shape, space, or data structure into two smaller parts (binary) based on specific criteria
- Normal vectors: a vector perpendicular (at 90 degrees) to a surface, curve, or plane at a specific point.
- [Specular properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection): the mirror-like reflection of waves, such as light, from a surface.
- "Raster display" = a screen made of a grid of pixels
### Existing Methods
- Before Phong algorithms, some methods were developed to approximate the objects to make them look more realistic. In general, all the methods listed below face a major limitation of _discontinuities at polygon boundaries_.
- Reducing the size of the polygons is not an actual solution because it would icnrease the number polygons and hence increase both the memory required to store the model and the time for hidden surface removal.
- Also, because of visual perception effects, the reduction of polygon size is not as beneficial as expecte ([Mach Band effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_bands)).
  
| Method | Explanation | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
|Planar approximation|Represent curved surfaces/objects using small planar polygons. E.g., imagine a 2D cone, we can use individual triangles of different shapes and sizes to approximate the curved surface of the cone.| **Contour edge** problem: the outline of the polygons itself is not a smooth curve. Another problem is about shading realistically.|
|Warnock's binary subdivision process|keep splitting the screen into smaller and smaller pieces (like cutting a picture in half, then in quarters, then smaller…) until each tiny piece was simple enough to figure out.|The **order** of generating display data is not consistent with the order of the scanning and polygons in memory, which makes shading because we lose track of the neighboring pixels to create a smooth, orderly shade.| 
|Watkins' scan line by line|Generates the displayed picture scan line by line. On each line, computes the polygons that intersect the line, and then computest the visible segment of each polygon. Imagine a picture of a wall with a ball in front of it. There are some scan lines that intersect the ball shape (polygon) fully. The visible segment of the ball polygon is then computed.|N/A|
|Newell, Newell, and Sancha frame buffer|Paint the farthest face first, and the nearest face last.|The ability to generate highlights is severely limited due to the inability to vary light intensity over the surface of any single polygon.|
|Shading with [Polyhedral Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope_model)|**Cosine law**: The shading of each point on a polygon is the _product_ of a shading coefficient for the polygon and the cosine of the angle between the polygon normal and the direction of incident light. $S_p = C_p\cos(i)$|Does not allow for any of the _specular_ properties of the material. The poor effect when using it to display _smooth curved_ surfaces. The cosine law rule is only appropriate for objects properly modeled with planar surfaces such as boxes and buildings.|
|Gouraud's shading (continuous gradation of shade)|A surface represented by a patch is approximated by polygonal planar facets -> computes infor about the curvature of the surface at each vertex of each of these facets -> a shade intensity is computed and retained -> then it is linearly interpolated along the edge between adjacent pairs of vertices of the object.|The problem of apparent discontinuity across polygon edges.|

### Phong Shading Algorithm
- Bùi Tường Phong suggested several improvements to Gouraud's technique using a physical model
- **Specular Reflection**: Determine the _normal to the surface at each point to be shaded_ -> infor about the direction of reflected rays be acquired

$$
N_t = tN_1 + (1-t)N_0
$$

- **Shading Function Model**: a function which yields the intensity value of each point on the body of an object from the characteristics of the light source, the object, and the positon of the observer

$$
S_p = C_p[\cos(i)(1-d)+d] + W(i)[\cos(s)]^n
$$
